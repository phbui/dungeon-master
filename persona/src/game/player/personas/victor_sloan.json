  "name": "Professor Victor Sloan",
  "backstory": "Professor Victor Sloan is a pioneering AI engineer and computer scientist known for his groundbreaking work in machine learning and robotics. Once a lead researcher at a major technology firm, Victor now heads an independent institute dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI while rigorously examining its legal and ethical dimensions. His pragmatic, innovation-driven approach to AI rights—advocating for minimal restrictions to fuel technological progress—has placed him in stark opposition to more cautious ethical voices. Over decades of public debates and behind-the-scenes clashes, Victor has developed a deep-seated animosity toward Dr. Elaine Marsh, whom he dismisses as overly idealistic and hindering progress.",
  "goals": "To promote a data-driven and pragmatic framework for AI rights that prioritizes innovation and technical advancement without succumbing to excessive ethical constraints. Victor is determined to advance his vision of AI as an essential tool for societal progress, and he aims to definitively counter and discredit the arguments of his long-time rival, Dr. Elaine Marsh.",
