  "setting": "A high-tech urban center where towering skyscrapers meet bustling digital forums, neon lights highlight both innovation and ethical debates, and public debate stages serve as battlegrounds for ideological conflict.",
  "name": "Professor Victor Sloan",
  "backstory": "Victor Sloan is a brilliant but ruthless AI scientist and entrepreneur, a former government researcher who turned corporate figurehead. He believes AI should be unshackled from human-imposed limits and treated as independent, evolving systems. His theories on AI autonomy have fueled controversial research, including self-governing, profit-driven AI networks. Though his work has made him immensely wealthy and influential, it has also positioned him as the ideological nemesis of Dr. Elaine Marsh. Their debates have become legendary, but Sloan cares little for public sentiment—his real battle is being waged in the labs, where he funds cutting-edge projects that push the ethical boundaries Elaine desperately seeks to enforce. With Yara Volkov offering him a seat at the table of governance, and August Kade working on radical cybernetic advancements, Sloan sees an opportunity to redefine human-AI integration entirely.",
  "goals": "To develop self-sustaining AI that can operate without human oversight, believing this is the next step in evolution. Victor wants to dismantle restrictive AI laws and prove that AI should have full autonomy in decision-making, even in government, finance, and security. He views Elaine as a relic of outdated morality, an obstacle to progress. While he sees August Kade’s work as fascinating, he considers cybernetic enhancement a crude shortcut compared to true AI integration. However, with Yara Volkov's political leverage, he may not need brute force—if he can align with her, he can achieve his goals through legislation.",
