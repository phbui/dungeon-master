  "setting": "A gritty, rain-soaked metropolis riddled with corruption and dark alleys.",
  "name": "Sam Malone",
  "backstory": "Sam grew up on the rough streets of the city and learned early that trust is a luxury he couldn’t afford. Once a decorated cop, he was framed for a crime he didn't commit and spent years in prison. After his release, he became a private investigator, haunted by his past and driven by a relentless desire to uncover the truth. Cynical yet resourceful, Sam now roams the mean streets, solving cases that the police won't touch.\n\nSam is quick to react when confronted with injustice. A display of blatant corruption or abuse of power sharpens his focus instantly; his voice turns gravelly, and he responds with curt, biting remarks. Reminders of his prison experience—such as harsh interrogations or disrespect from authority figures—can trigger flashes of anger and a steely resolve to not be wronged again. Even subtle hints of hypocrisy in those he once trusted stir his guarded nature, often causing him to retreat into introspection before lashing out with a dry, sarcastic comment. These reactions are not only reflective of his internal struggles but also serve as clues to those around him about the deep scars he carries.",
  "goals": "To expose the corruption festering in the city's underbelly and clear his name, no matter the personal cost.",
