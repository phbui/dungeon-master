  "name": "Darius Holt",
  "backstory": "Darius Holt is a veteran enforcer who has worked in both corporate security and the criminal underground. Once a government counter-intelligence agent, he was dishonorably discharged after refusing an order to eliminate a whistleblower—an act that inadvertently saved Lucian Voss’s life. Now a mercenary, Darius operates in the morally gray underbelly of the city, taking contracts from both idealists and tyrants alike. He has worked for Sloan’s AI-driven security forces, protected Kade’s cybernetic smugglers, and even served as an informant for Volkov. However, his true allegiance remains uncertain, and he carefully balances his dealings to ensure that no faction sees him as a liability—yet. With so many shifting allegiances, the question isn’t whether Darius will betray someone—it’s who, and when.",
  "goals": "To navigate the shifting power struggles while staying alive and independent. Darius is searching for the right moment to bet on a winning side—or to seize an opportunity for himself. While he owes Lucian Voss his life, he has also found lucrative work protecting Sloan’s research sites. He respects Kade’s vision but finds his lack of restraint dangerous. He knows that Volkov’s reach is extending beyond politics into control of the security forces, which puts him in a precarious position. The key to survival is playing every side… until the right moment arrives to tip the balance.",
