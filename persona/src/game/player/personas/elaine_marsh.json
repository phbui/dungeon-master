  "backstory": "Dr. Elaine Marsh is a renowned tech ethicist and philosopher with over two decades of experience in exploring the ethical implications of emerging technologies. After earning her Ph.D. in Philosophy and Technology, she emerged as a leading advocate for robust AI rights and comprehensive ethical guidelines. Elaine’s cautious, human-centric approach to AI governance has led her into relentless, public disputes with Professor Victor Sloan. Their rivalry, fueled by conflicting ideologies, has evolved into a bitter, decades-long personal feud—one that has left an indelible mark on both their careers.",
  "goals": "To establish comprehensive ethical guidelines for AI rights that ensure transparency, accountability, and the protection of human values. Elaine is committed to shaping policy that imposes strict safeguards on AI, countering what she perceives as Victor Sloan's dangerously permissive approach. Her objective is not only to advance her ethical framework but also to expose and ultimately defeat the pragmatic, profit-driven vision championed by her adversary.",
